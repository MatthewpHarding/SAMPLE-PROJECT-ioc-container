/*
    ðŸ’¡ Coding Test Scenario
    This is just a reminder about the coding test scenario.
    Client applications may use circular dependencies even though they reflect rather poor architectutral discisions.
    It is not the role of this Framework to prevent them nor encourage them, but rather Â´supportÂ´them in a mild manner.
 
    At the very least, we can create some unit tests to understand the scenario and situation a little better.
