/*
    ðŸ’¡ Circular Dependency Scenario
    
    Client applications may use circular dependencies even though they reflect rather poor architectutral discisions.
    It is not the role of this Framework to prevent them nor encourage them, but rather Â´supportÂ´them in a mild manner.
 
    At the very least, we can create some unit tests to understand the scenario and situation a little better.

Both won't be removed from memory and thus the client of the SwincyBox framework should re-think their core architecture. This has been included as test for a valid use-case scenario within client apps and how they may use this framework.
