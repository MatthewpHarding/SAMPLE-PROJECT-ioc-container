# ``SwincyBox``

A Light-Weight Swift DI (Dependency Injection) Framework  for iOS. Also known as an IOC Container.

## Overview
 
This small yet powerful iOS framework operates within 201 lines of code, applying principles from Swift Generics and light recursion for dependency resolution. A simple ``Box`` is all that is required to first register any dependencies (`Services`), followed by repeated calls to resolve.

This framework supports the Swift type `Any` supporting the registration and resolution of both `Classes` and `Structs`.
